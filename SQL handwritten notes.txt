Q. Difference between union & union all?

Ans: Union or union all command used to combine result set of two or more select statement
(Union operator won't allow duplicate entires where as union all allow duplicate. null entires allowed by union & unionall)
every select statmetns with union must have same number of columns.
The column must have similar data types

Ex: 
	select CITY from Customers
	union
	select city from Suppliers


Q. Difference between unique, primary & foreign key

Unique constraint & primary key allow only unique value in column where as in table we can have 
multiple column having unique constraint but column having primary key constraint must be one

foreign key will prevent the actions that destroy link between two table.

foreign key in one table refer to primary key in another table.
