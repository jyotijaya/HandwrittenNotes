Scenario Based Questions:
============================
Q. Let's say you are working on a platform written in REST and migrated now to GraphQL,
 you just hit the main page and a few of the critical features are not loading or maybe appearing blank on the page,
 whats all the steps you'll perform before reporting this to dev?

Ans: 
-> First step to clear all cache, form data, session, cookies & history because 
some time API fail for status 200 because of stale state. 
-> Goto console in dev tool to see if any error
-> Goto network tab to see the respected API endpoints throwing any error
-> May be because of incoreect json schema or configuration issue API data not reflecting 
on UI or we are not getting proper response.
-> There may be chance that Ui developer not handled properly the integration of API data to UI
-> use postman or charles to manually check whether we are using correct endpoint, payload, authentication, headers & response.
-> In some cases we can check system logs in grafana.




Framework:
===================

Manual Testing:
==================
1. When a tester uses documentation, such as design documents and use cases, to check if the software works as it should, 
what is this process called?

2. What is the best testing method for a QA engineer to use when they have to test a new platform and there 
is no documentation available?

3. There is an enterprise system with three applications named App1, App2, and App3. App1 and App3 are still being worked on, 
but App2 is about to be released. 
What type of testing should be done to make sure that releasing App2 won't cause any problems for the entire system?

Core Java:
=================
1. What is functional interface?
ans: An interface where we have only one abstract method & can have multiple default methods. It is also called as single interface abstract methods or SAM.
Consumer, Runnable, Comparable are some of examples of functional interface.

2.  How hashmap works internally?
    How hashtable works internally?
    How Treemap works internally?

3. How to make read only class
Make the data member private & access it through getter method.

4. How to create immutable class
Make class as final
Data memeber also final & private
A parameterized constructor should initialize all the fields performing a deep copy so that data members canâ€™t be modified with an object reference.
Deep Copy of objects should be performed in the getter methods to return a copy rather than returning the actual object reference)
Don't provide setter methods

5. What is exception propagation?
Its a process of throwing the exception from parent function to calling function & so on . In other words throwing from top to bottom of the stack. 
At the bottom main method is the function

Unchecked exception propagated using throw keyword.
Checked exception throw compilation error & we must have to declare throws keyword in function signature.

6. What is synchronization in java?

7. Why pointer not use in Java?
JVM implictly responsible to allocate memroy & deallocate. And direct acces to memory address for user also we can avoid

8. JIT compiler: JIT compiler compile & converts byte code into machine code . 
It is present in JVM.
9. Factory design pattern
10. Singleton design pattern
Ans: Ensuring single instance of a class exists.
TO achieve singleton behaviour follow below steps:
* Declare all constructor of the class as private
* Create instance through static method.

Code snippet:
====================
class Demo
{
	private static Demo instance=null;
	private Demo()
	{
		
		
	}
	Demo(String s)
	{
		
	}
	
	public static Demo getInstance()
	{
		if(instance==null)
		{
			instance=new Demo();
		}
		
		return instance;
	}
	
}
public class Singleton2 {

	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Demo d1=Demo.getInstance();
		Demo d2=Demo.getInstance();
		System.out.println(d1); //DesignPattern.Demo@15db9742
		System.out.println(d2); //DesignPattern.Demo@15db9742
		
	}

}




11. What is static imports in java and why do we need it?
12. Can we synchronized an ArrayList? (Yes)

Code snippet:
==================
			        List l=Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList());
					l.add(20);
					l.add("ss");
					l.add(3);
					
					
					synchronized (l) {
						Iterator it=l.iterator();
						while(it.hasNext())
						{
							System.out.println(it.next());
						}
					}
Code snippet:
---------------------
					CopyOnWriteArrayList a=new CopyOnWriteArrayList();
					a.add(20);
					a.add("ss");
					a.add(3);
					
					System.out.println(a);



13. Explain life cycle of Maven.
	8 stages of maven
1. Validate 2.compile 3.test 4.package 5.integration test 6. verify 7.Install 8. Deploy

*. Validate: Check the folder structure & validate all dependecies downloaded & store it in local repository(.m2 folder)
*. compile: Check syntax of source code & convert .java into .class file & store it in classes/target folder.
*. test: Run all unit test
*. Package: package the compiled code into jar or war file
*. integration test: run integration test for project
*. verify: Verify project meet all required standards & valid.
*. install: install the package code into local reports
*. Deploy: Deploy package into remote server so that other dev can use

Commands for maven:
mvn clean: it will remove all dependecies from previous build
mvn compile: compile the source code
mvn test-compile: compile the test code only
mvn install: Deploy the packaged jar/war to local reports

=================================
Core Java logical programming:
=================================
1. Program to remove duplicates from list.
2. program to convert hashmap value to capitalize or Uppercase. 
Solution:
        HashMap<Integer, String> languages = new HashMap<>();
        languages.put(1, "java");
        languages.put(2, "javascript");
        languages.put(3, "python");
        // Change all value to uppercase
        languages.replaceAll((key, value) -> value.toUpperCase());

				for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
				{
					for(int j=i+1;j<arr.length;j++)
					{
						if(arr[i]==arr[j])
						{
							if(a.contains(arr[i]))
							{
								break;
							}
							else
							{
								a.add(arr[i]);
								flag=true;
							}
						}
					}
				}
				if (flag == true) { 
					  
					System.out.print(a + " "); 
				} 
				else { 
					System.out.print( 
						"No duplicates present in arrays"); 
				}

Using HashSet:
-------------------

				HashSet<Integer> a=new HashSet<Integer>();
				int[] arr= {1,2,3,2,3,2,1,1,1,10,10,7,8};
				
				boolean flag=false;
				for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
				{
					for(int j=i+1;j<arr.length;j++)
					{
						if(arr[i]==arr[j])
						{
							a.add(arr[i]);
							flag=true;
						}
					}
				}
				if (flag == true) { 
					  
					System.out.print(a + " "); 
				} 
				else { 
					System.out.print( 
						"No duplicates present in arrays"); 
				}



6. WAP to print given string is palindrome or not
7. Write logic for converting string from aaaaabbcdddffaazzh -->5a2bc3d2f2a2zh

				//1,2,3
				//5,6,7
				//9,10
				//20,21,23
				//25,26,27,28
				
				HashSet<Integer> h=new HashSet<Integer>();
				for(Integer i:arr)
				{
					h.add(i);
				}

				int greatestNum=0;
				for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
				{
					if(!h.contains(arr[i]-1))
					{
						int num=arr[i];//5
						
						while(h.contains(num))
						{
							num++;//8
						}
						
						
						
						if(greatestNum<num-arr[i])
						{

				System.out.println(greatestNum);


9. Divide a string in N equal parts.
Selenium:
=================

1. WriteÂ  Xpath for text " //span[text()='%Firdous%'] " which should support multiple environments where text can be with containing space or Capitals.
2. Code is working in chrome or but throwing error in IE, how will you debug.
3. Various Exceptions observed in framework.
4. How to Handle no stale exception.
5. identifyÂ  xpath from amazon website.
6. How do you calculate ROI for Test Automation? ðŸ”º 

Ans: By calculating and demonstrating Test Automationâ€™s Return on Investment (ROI), we can be better convinced that the investment will be worthwhile in the long run. Delivering more quantitative numbers on building and maintaining a test automation framework may be more helpful to get everyone on board for Automation.

To calculate Automation ROI first you need to first calculate the Manual Execution time of your test case. This value can be updated in your Test Management Tool. 

Time Saved by Automation  =Manual Execution Time -  Automation Execution Time

Automation ROI = Time Saved by Automation / Investment. 
Investment = time required to build frameworks + maintenance cost + (time to code one tests X number of tests)

7. How to handle authnetication popup in selenium?
Ans: We need to integrate username & password in url itself so that directly it will login without authentication popup

syntax:
	https://username:password@google.com

8. How to read from Json to dataprovider in selenium?
9. If tomorrow all test script got failed. What would be the reason
May be some wrong code merged
May be test data got changed
May be some API change which is not reflecting on UI
May be wrong use of locators. Lets say if any latest new which is dynamic & if we use text() to identify that element then script may fail
Any new feature affect
may be network issue, latency issue
May be browser updated. We need to update driver.



SQL:
=================
1. Write sql query for left outer join?
	SELECT column_name(s)
	FROM table1
	LEFT JOIN table2
	ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

2. how to get second high salary.

	SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE
	WHERE SALARY<(SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEE);

(OR)

	SELECT SALARY FROM(SELECT SALARY FROM EMPLOYEE ORDER BY SALARY DESC LIMIT 2) EMPLOYEE ORDER BY SALARY LIMIT 1;

3. Difference between union & union all
Ans: Union or union all command used to combine result set of two or more select statement
(Union operator won't allow duplicate entires where as union all allow duplicate. null entires allowed by union & unionall)
every select statmetns with union must have same number of columns.
The column must have similar data types

Ex: 
	select CITY from Customers
	union
	select city from Suppliers
